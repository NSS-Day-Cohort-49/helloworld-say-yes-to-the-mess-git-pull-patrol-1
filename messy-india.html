                  <h3>Main Cities</h3>
               </div>
               <ul>
                  <li>New Delhi is the capital of India and an administrative district of NCT Delhi. New Delhi is also the seat of all three branches of
                  the government of India, hosting the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Parliament House, and the Supreme Court of India.
                  
                  Although colloquially Delhi and New Delhi are used interchangeably to refer to the National Capital Territory of Delhi
                  (NCT), these are two distinct entities, with New Delhi forming a small part of the city of Delhi. The National Capital
                  Region is a much larger entity comprising the entire NCT along with adjoining districts in neighbouring states which
                  includes but is not limited to Ghaziabad, Noida, Gurgaon and Faridabad.
                  
                  The foundation stone of New Delhi was laid by George V during the Delhi Durbar of 1911.[6] It was designed by British
                  architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker. The new capital was inaugurated on 13 February 1931,[7] by Viceroy and
                  Governor-General Irwin.</li>
                  <li>Mumbai is the financial, commercial,[30] and the entertainment capital of India. It is also one of the world's top ten
                  centres of commerce in terms of global financial flow,[31] generating 6.16% of India's GDP,[32] and accounting for 25%
                  of industrial output, 70% of maritime trade in India (Mumbai Port Trust and JNPT),[33] and 70% of capital transactions
                  to India's economy.[34][35] Mumbai has the eighth-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world,[36] and
                  Mumbai's billionaires had the highest average wealth of any city in the world in 2008.[37][38] The city houses important
                  financial institutions and the corporate headquarters of numerous Indian companies and multinational corporations. It is
                  also home to some of India's premier scientific and nuclear institutes. The city is also home to Bollywood and Marathi
                  cinema industries. Mumbai's business opportunities attract migrants from all over India.</li>
                  <li>Bangalore is widely regarded as the "Silicon Valley of India" (or "IT capital of India") because of its role as the
                  nation's leading information technology (IT) exporter.[1] Indian technological organisations are headquartered in the
                  city. A demographically diverse city, Bangalore is the second fastest-growing major metropolis in India.[17][18] Recent
                  estimates of the metro economy of its urban area have ranked Bangalore either the fourth- or fifth-most productive metro
                  area of India.[10][19] Bangalore is home to 7,700 millionaires and 8 billionaires with a total wealth of $320
                  billion.[20][21] It is home to many educational and research institutions. Numerous state-owned aerospace and defence
                  organisations, are located in the city. The city also houses the Kannada film industry. It was ranked the most liveable
                  Indian city with a population of over a million under the Ease of Living Index 2020.[22]</li>

                  <h3>Famous Landmarks</h3>
               </div>
               <ul>
                  <li>Taj Mahal originally the Rauza-i-munawwara is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna in the
                  Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house
                  the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece
                  of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on
                  three sides by a crenellated wall.
                  
                  Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for
                  another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated
                  at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $956
                  million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the
                  court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.
                  
                  The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one
                  of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal
                  architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year and in 2007, it
                  was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.</li>
                  <li>Fatehpur Sikri is a town in the Agra District of Uttar Pradesh, India. The city itself was founded as the capital of Mughal Empire in
                  1571 by Emperor Akbar, serving this role from 1571 to 1585, when Akbar abandoned it due to a campaign in Punjab and was
                  later completely abandoned in 1610.[3]
                  
                  The name of the city is derived from the village called Sikri which occupied the spot before. An Archaeological Survey
                  of India (ASI) excavation from 1999 to 2000 indicated that there was a habitation, temples and commercial centres here
                  before Akbar built his capital. The region was settled by Sungas following their expansion. In 12th century, it was
                  briefly controlled by Sikarwar Rajputs.
                  
                  The khanqah of Sheikh Salim existed earlier at this place. Akbar's son Jahangir was born at the village of Sikri in 1569
                  and that year Akbar began construction of a religious compound to commemorate the Sheikh who had predicted the birth.
                  After Jahangir's second birthday, he began the construction of a walled city and imperial palace here. The city came to
                  be known as Fatehpur Sikri, the "City of Victory", after Akbar's victorious Gujarat campaign in 1573.
                  
                  After occupying Agra in 1803, the English established an administrative center here and it remained so until 1850. In
                  1815, the Marquess of Hastings ordered repair of monuments at Sikri.</li>
                  <li>Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 14th century.[3] Chronicles left by Persian and European travellers,
                  particularly the Portuguese, say that Hampi was a prosperous, wealthy and grand city near the Tungabhadra River, with
                  numerous temples, farms and trading markets. By 1500 CE, Hampi-Vijayanagara was the world's second-largest medieval-era
                  city after Beijing, and probably India's richest at that time, attracting traders from Persia and Portugal.[4][5] The
                  Vijayanagara Empire was defeated by a coalition of Muslim sultanates; its capital was conquered, pillaged and destroyed
                  by sultanate armies in 1565, after which Hampi remained in ruins.[3][6][7]
                  
                  Located in Karnataka near the modern-era city of Hosapete, Hampi's ruins are spread over 4,100 hectares (16 sq mi) and
                  it has been described by UNESCO as an "austere, grandiose site" of more than 1,600 surviving remains of the last great
                  Hindu kingdom in South India that includes "forts, riverside features, royal and sacred complexes, temples, shrines,
                  pillared halls, mandapas, memorial structures, water structures and others".[8]
                  
                  Hampi predates the Vijayanagara Empire, it is mentioned in the Ramayana and the Puranas of Hinduism as Pampaa Devi
                  Tirtha Kshetra.[3][9] Hampi continues to be an important religious centre, housing the Virupaksha Temple, an active Adi
                  Shankara-linked monastery and various monuments belonging to the old city.[6][10]</li>
                  <li>The Lotus Temple, located in Delhi, India, is a Baháʼí House of Worship that was dedicated in December 1986.[1] Notable
                  for its flowerlike shape, it has become a prominent attraction in the city. Like all Baháʼí Houses of Worship, the Lotus
                  Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or any other qualification. According to Shoghi Effendi, a Bahá'í temple
                  is a “silent teacher” of the Bahá'í faith.[2] The building is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged
                  in clusters of three to form nine sides,[3] with nine doors opening onto a central hall with a height of slightly over
                  34 meters[3] and a capacity of 2,500 people.[4] The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural awards and has been
                  featured in many newspaper and magazine articles.[5] A 2001 CNN report referred to it as the most visited building in
                  the world.[6]</li>

               <ul>
                  <li>Mahatma Gandhi (/ˈɡɑːndi, ˈɡændi/;[2] 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer,[3] anti-colonial nationalist,[4] and
                  political ethicist,[5] who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from
                  British rule,[6] and in turn inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā
                  (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the
                  world.[7][8]
                  
                  Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, western India, Gandhi trained in law at the Inner Temple, London,
                  and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a
                  successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893, to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to
                  live in South Africa for 21 years. It was in South Africa that Gandhi raised a family, and first employed nonviolent
                  resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India. He set about organising peasants,
                  farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination. Assuming leadership of the Indian
                  National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building
                  religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and above all for achieving Swaraj or self-rule.[9]
                  
                  The same year Gandhi adopted the Indian loincloth, or short dhoti and, in the winter, a shawl, both woven with yarn
                  hand-spun on a traditional Indian spinning wheel, or charkha, as a mark of identification with India's rural poor.
                  Thereafter, he lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community, ate simple vegetarian food, and undertook long
                  fasts as a means of self-purification and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians,
                  Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930, and later
                  in calling for the British to Quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned for many years, upon many occasions, in both South
                  Africa and India.
                  
                  Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a new Muslim
                  nationalism which was demanding a separate Muslim homeland carved out of India.[10] In August 1947, Britain granted
                  independence, but the British Indian Empire[10] was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and
                  Muslim-majority Pakistan.[11] As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious
                  violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Eschewing the official celebration of independence in Delhi,
                  Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to provide solace. In the months following, he undertook several fasts
                  unto death to stop religious violence. The last of these, undertaken on 12 January 1948 when he was 78,[12] also had the
                  indirect goal of pressuring India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan.[12] Some Indians thought Gandhi was too
                  accommodating.[12][13] Among them was Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, who assassinated Gandhi on 30 January 1948 by
                  firing three bullets into his chest.[13]
                  
                  Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the
                  International Day of Nonviolence. Gandhi is commonly, though not formally, considered the Father of the Nation in
                  India,[14][15] and was commonly called Bapu[16] (Gujarati: endearment for father,[17] papa[17][18]).</li>
                  <li>Mother Teresa (born Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu, Albanian: [aˈɲɛzə ˈɡɔndʒɛ bɔjaˈdʒiu]; 26 August 1910 – 5 September 1997), honoured in the
                  Catholic Church as Saint Teresa of Calcutta,[7] was an Albanian-Indian[4] Roman Catholic nun and missionary.[8] She was
                  born in Skopje (now the capital of North Macedonia), then part of the Kosovo Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. After living
                  in Skopje for eighteen years, she moved to Ireland and then to India, where she lived for most of her life.
                  
                  In 1950, Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic religious congregation that had over 4,500 nuns
                  and was active in 133 countries in 2012. The congregation manages homes for people who are dying of HIV/AIDS, leprosy
                  and tuberculosis. It also runs soup kitchens, dispensaries, mobile clinics, children's and family counselling
                  programmes, as well as orphanages and schools. Members take vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience, and also profess a
                  fourth vow – to give "wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor."[9]
                  
                  Teresa received a number of honors, including the 1962 Ramon Magsaysay Peace Prize and the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize. She
                  was canonised on 4 September 2016, and the anniversary of her death (5 September) is her feast day. A controversial
                  figure during her life and after her death, Teresa was admired by many for her charitable work. She was praised and
                  criticized on various counts, such as for her views on abortion and contraception, and was criticized for poor
                  conditions in her houses for the dying. Her authorized biography was written by Navin Chawla and published in 1992, and
                  she has been the subject of films and other books. On 6 September 2017, Teresa and St. Francis Xavier were named
                  co-patrons of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Calcutta.</li>
                  <li>Jaggi Vasudev (born 3 September 1957),[2] known publicly as Sadhguru,[2][a] is an Indian yogi and author.[6][7][8]
                  
                  Vasudev earned a bachelor's degree in English from the University of Mysore and has been teaching yoga in southern India
                  since 1982. In 1992, he established Isha Foundation near Coimbatore, which runs an ashram, hosts a yoga centre, and has
                  been involved in various activities in spirituality, education, and the environment.
                  
                  Vasudev is the author of several books, including Inner Engineering: A Yogi's Guide to Joy (2016). As a public speaker
                  he has spoken at the United Nation's Millennium World Peace Summit, the British parliament's House of Lords, the
                  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the International Institute for Management Development. He has also spoken at
                  the annual World Economic Forum in 2007, 2017 and 2020.
                  
                  In 2017, he was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian award, by the Government of India for his
                  contribution to social services.</li>
                  <li>Ravi Shankar (Bengali pronunciation: [ˈrobi ˈʃɔŋkor]; born Robindro Shaunkor Chowdhury,[2] spelled Ravindra Shankar Chowdhury in
                  Sanskrit;[3] 7 April 1920 – 11 December 2012), whose name is often preceded by the title Pandit (Master), was an Indian
                  sitar virtuoso and a composer. He became the world's best-known exponent of North Indian classical music, in the second
                  half of the 20th century,[4] and influenced many other musicians throughout the world. Shankar was awarded India's
                  highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, in 1999.
                  
                  Shankar was born to a Bengali Brahmin family[5][6] in India,[7] and spent his youth as a dancer touring India and Europe
                  with the dance group of his brother Uday Shankar. He gave up dancing in 1938 to study sitar playing under court musician
                  Allauddin Khan. After finishing his studies in 1944, Shankar worked as a composer, creating the music for the Apu
                  Trilogy by Satyajit Ray, and was music director of All India Radio, New Delhi, from 1949 to 1956.
                  
                  In 1956, Shankar began to tour Europe and the Americas playing Indian classical music and increased its popularity there
                  in the 1960s through teaching, performance, and his association with violinist Yehudi Menuhin and Beatles guitarist
                  George Harrison. His influence on Harrison helped popularize the use of Indian instruments in Western pop music in the
                  latter half of the 1960s. Shankar engaged Western music by writing compositions for sitar and orchestra, and toured the
                  world in the 1970s and 1980s. From 1986 to 1992, he served as a nominated member of Rajya Sabha, the upper chamber of
                  the Parliament of India. He continued to perform until the end of his life.</li>
                  <li>Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi (Hindi: [ˈɪndɪɾa ˈɡaːndʱi] (About this soundlisten); née Nehru; 19 November 1917 – 31
                  October 1984) was an Indian politician and a central figure of the Indian National Congress.[2] She was the first and,
                  to date, only female Prime Minister of India. Indira Gandhi was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime
                  minister of India. She served as prime minister from January 1966 to March 1977 and again from January 1980 until her
                  assassination in October 1984, making her the second longest-serving Indian prime minister after her father.[3]
                  
                  During Nehru's time as Prime Minister of India from 1947 to 1964, Gandhi was considered a key assistant and accompanied
                  him on his numerous foreign trips.[4] She was elected President of the Indian National Congress in 1959. Upon her
                  father's death in 1964, she was appointed as a member of the Rajya Sabha (upper house) and became a member of Lal
                  Bahadur Shastri's cabinet as Minister of Information and Broadcasting.[5] In the Congress Party's parliamentary
                  leadership election held in early 1966 (upon the death of Shastri), she defeated her rival Morarji Desai to become
                  leader, and thus succeeded Shastri as Prime Minister of India.
                  
                  As prime minister, Gandhi was known for her political intransigency and unprecedented centralisation of power. She went
                  to war with Pakistan in support of the independence movement and war of independence in East Pakistan, which resulted in
                  an Indian victory and the creation of Bangladesh, as well as increasing India's influence to the point where it became
                  the sole regional power of South Asia. Citing separatist tendencies, and in response to a call for revolution, Gandhi
                  instituted a state of emergency from 1975 to 1977 where basic civil liberties were suspended and the press was censored.
                  Widespread atrocities were carried out during the emergency.[6] In 1980, she returned to power after free and fair
                  elections. After Gandhi ordered military action in the Golden Temple in Operation Blue Star, her own bodyguards and Sikh
                  nationalists assassinated her on 31 October 1984.
                  
                  In 1999, Indira Gandhi was named "Woman of the Millennium" in an online poll organised by the BBC.[7] In 2020, Gandhi
                  was named by Time magazine among the world's 100 powerful women who defined the last century.[8][9]</li>
